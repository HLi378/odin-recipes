        <p>Medium Rare steak cooked with different kinds of herbs to enhance the steak's flavor</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New York Steak or Sirlion Steak or Ribeye Steak</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pat dry</strong>- use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
            <li><strong>Season generously</strong> just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear Steaks</strong>- add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
            <li><strong>Add Butter and Aromatics</strong>- melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to 145 degrees F.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove Steak</strong> and rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
