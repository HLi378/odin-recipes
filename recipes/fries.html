        <p>Easy and delicious fries</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatos</li>
            <li>white vinegar</li>
            <li>cooking salt</li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cut</strong>: Peel the potatoes. Cut into 6 mm / 1/4" French fries using a serrated knife.</li>
            <li>Keep cut fries submerged in a bowl of water to prevent them from going brown while you cut the remainder. (No need for actual soaking beyond this.)</li>
            <li><strong>Rinse</strong>: Transfer potatoes to a colander and rinse under tap water for 15 - 20 seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer</strong>: Place fries in a large pot with 2 litres/quarts of cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then immediately reduce stove to low so the surface is rippling gently, not big bubbles. Cook for 10 minutes then carefully remove using a slotted spoon into a colander (do not tip into colander, fries will break).</li>
            <li><strong>Dry 5 minutes</strong>: Spread the fries on 2 tea towel lined trays. Leave to steam dry for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Pot</strong>: Pour 3 cm / 1.2" of oil in a pot that is at least 10cm/4" high</li>
            <li><strong>Heat the oil</strong>: 205°C/400°F over medium high heat.</li>
            <li><strong>10 sec pause</strong>: Lower 1/3 of Batch 1 fries into the oil using a slotted spoon. WAIT 10 seconds, add another 1/3 of the fries, wait 10 seconds, then add the remaining Batch 1 fries.</li>
            <li><strong>50 seconds fry</strong>: Fry for 50 seconds, moving them around once or twice. Then remove with a slotted spoon onto 2 paper towel lined trays, spread out in a single layer. The fries will still be white and floppy.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat</strong>Fry #1 with Batches 2 and 3, ensuring the oil is back at 205°C/400°F before cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>30 minutes cool</strong>: Leaves fries to cool for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Line a large bowl</strong> for tossing</li>
            <li><strong>Fry #2</strong>Heat oil to 205°C/400°F. Fry half the French fries for 4 minutes, moving them around twice, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain in the lined bowl, then repeat with remaining fries.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle fries with salt or seasoning or choice. Toss and Serve!</li>
            <li>Fries will stay crispy even once cool.</li>
        </ol>
